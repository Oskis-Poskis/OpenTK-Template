### How to use:
1. Create a folder to hold two projects, the template and the one you will work on
2. Clone this repo, so there is a folder called OpenTK-Template inside the folder from step 1
3. Clone my [3D-Template](https://github.com/Oskis-Poskis/3D-Template) into the folder from step 1, or copy the required functions to create the window and UI
